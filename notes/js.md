JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic, such as by adding animations, responding to user input, and validating forms. It can also be used to build server-side applications and games.
