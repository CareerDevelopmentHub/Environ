```
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    /*...*/
    /*...*/
    /*...*/
  }
  /*...*/
  /*...*/
  /*...*/
  /*...*/
}
```

### Other common media queries include:

- min-width: Specifies a minimum screen width.
- max-height: Specifies a maximum screen height.
- orientation: Specifies the orientation of the device (portrait or landscape).
- aspect-ratio: Specifies the aspect ratio of the device's screen.
- resolution: Specifies the resolution of the device's screen.
- media type: Specifies the type of media on which the web page is being displayed (screen, print, speech, etc.).

Media queries can be used to style a variety of elements on a web page, including text, images, layout elements, and even other media queries. By using media queries, you can create web pages that look good and function well on all devices and media types.
