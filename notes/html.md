- Block Elemets: These are the elements which covers the entire width i.e `<div>Inline Element</div>`
- Inline Elements: These are the elements which covers only the width required by the element i.e. `<span>Inline Element</span>`

## Attributes & Values

HTML attributes are additional pieces of information that can be added to HTML elements to change their appearance or behavior. Attributes are specified in the start tag of an element, and are made up of a name and a value. For example, the following <img> element has two attributes: src and alt.

```
<img src="my-image.png" alt="My image">
```
